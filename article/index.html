				<h2>Why Do Cats Like Boxes?</h2>
				<p>
					"Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide,"
					Stephen Zawistowski, science adviser for the American Society for the
					Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Business Insider. "And a box
					gives them a place of safety and security."
				</p>
				<p>
					While inside a box, cats feel that they cannot be snuck up on from
					behind or the side â€” anything that wants to approach them must come
					directly into their field of vision. In effect, such hiding spaces
					allow them to watch the world around them without being seen.
