		<h1>20000 Leagues Under the Sea</h1>

				<p>
					The year 1866 was signalized by a remarkable incident, a mysterious
					and inexplicable phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.
					Not to mention rumors which agitated the maritime population, and
					excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring
					men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of
					vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all
					countries, and the Governments of several states on the two
					continents, were deeply interested in the matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					For some time past, vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a
					long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and
					infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
				</p>
				<p>
					The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log books)
					agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
					question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power
					of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If
					it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified
					in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at
					divers times- rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to
					this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated
					opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length- we
					might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
					dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at
					all. And that it did exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that
					tendency which disposes the human mind in favor of the marvelous, we
					can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
					supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the
					idea was out of the question.
				</p>
				<p>
					July 20, 1866, the steamer <cite>Governor Higginson</cite>, of the
					Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving
					mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought
					at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sand bank; he even
					prepared to determine its exact position, when two columns of water,
					projected by the inexplicable object, shot with a hissing noise a
					hundred fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sand bank had been
					submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the
					<cite>Governor Higginson</cite> had to do neither more nor less than
					with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its
					blowholes columns of water mixed with air and vapor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar facts were observed on July 23 in the same year, in the
					Pacific Ocean, by the <cite>Columbus</cite>, of the West India and
					Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary cetaceous
					creature could transport itself from one place to another with
					surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the
					<cite>Governor Higginson</cite> and the <cite>Columbus</cite> had
					observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a
					distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the
					<cite>Helvetia</cite>, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the
					<cite>Shannon</cite>, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company, sailing to
					windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying between the United
					States and Europe, respectively signaled the monster to each other in
					42° 15' N. latitude and 60° 35' W. longitude. In these simultaneous
					observations, they thought themselves justified in estimating the
					minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred fifty feet, as
					the <cite>Shannon</cite> and <cite>Helvetia</cite> were of smaller
					dimensions than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea
					round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never
					exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.
				</p>
				<p>
					These reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations
					made on board the transatlantic ship <cite>Pereire</cite>, a collision
					which occurred between the Etna of the Inman line and the monster, a
					<em>procès verbal</em> directed by the officers of the French frigate
					<cite>Normandie</cite>, a very accurate survey made by the staff of
					Commodore Fitz-James on board the <cite>Lord Clyde</cite>, greatly
					influenced public opinion. Light thinking people jested upon the
					phenomenon, but grave practical countries, such as England, America,
					and Germany, treated the matter more seriously.
				</p>
				<p>
					In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion. They sang
					of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on
					the stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There
					appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary
					creature, from the white whale, the terrible "Moby Dick" of
					hyperborean regions, to the immense kraken whose tentacles could
					entangle a ship of five hundred tons, and hurry it into the abyss of
					the ocean. The legends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and
					the opinions of Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the
					existence of these monsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop
					Pontoppidan, the accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the
					reports of Mr. Harrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who
					affirmed that, being on board the <cite>Castillan</cite>, in 1857, he
					had seen this enormous serpent, which had never until that time
					frequented any other seas but those of the ancient
					<cite>"Constitutionnel"</cite>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous
					and the incredulous in the societies of savants and scientific
					journals. "The question of the monster" inflamed all minds. Editors of
					scientific journals, quarreling with believers in the supernatural,
					spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing
					blood; for, from the sea serpent, they came to direct personalities.
				</p>
				<p>
					For six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading
					articles of the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy
					of Science of Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian
					Institution of Washington, in the discussions of the "Indian
					Archipelago," in le Cosmos of the Abbe Moigno, in the Mitteilungen of
					Petermann, in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of
					France and other countries. The cheaper journals replied keenly and
					with inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of
					Linnaeus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining "that
					nature did not make fools," and adjured their contemporaries not to
					give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea
					serpents, "Moby Dicks," and other lucubrations of delirious sailors.
					At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a favorite
					contributor, the chief of the staff, settled the monster, like
					Hippolytus, giving it the death blow amidst a universal burst of
					laughter. Wit had conquered science.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the first months of the year 1867, the question seemed buried
					never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was
					then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger
					seriously to be avoided. The question took quite another shape. The
					monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of
					indefinite and shifting proportions.
				</p>
				<p>
					On March 5, 1867, the <cite>Moravian</cite>, of the Montreal Ocean
					Company, finding herself during the night in 27° 30' latitude and 72°
					15' longitude, struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no
					chart for that part of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind
					and its four hundred horse power, it was going at the rate of thirteen
					knots. Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the
					<cite>Moravian</cite>, she would have been broken by the shock, and
					gone down with the 237 passengers she was bringing home from Canada.
				</p>
				<p>
					The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day
					was breaking. The officers of the quarterdeck hurried to the after
					part of the vessel. They examined the sea with the most scrupulous
					attention. They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables'
					length distant, as if the surface had been violently agitated. The
					bearings of the place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued
					its route without apparent damage. Had it struck on a submerged rock,
					or on an enormous wreck? They could not tell; but on examination of
					the ship's bottom when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of
					her keel was broken.
				</p>
				<p>
					This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like
					many others, if, three weeks after, it had not been reenacted under
					similar circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of
					the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel
					belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.
				</p>
				<p>
					April 13, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze favorable, the
					<cite>Scotia</cite> of the Cunard Company's line found herself in 15°
					12' longitude and 45° 37' latitude. She was going at the speed of
					thirteen and a half knots.
				</p>
				<p>
					At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, while the passengers
					were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt
					on the hull of the <cite>Scotia</cite>, on her quarter, a little aft
					of the port paddle.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <cite>Scotia</cite> had not struck, but she had been struck, and
					seemingly by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The
					shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been
					for the shouts of the carpenter's watch, who rushed on to the bridge,
					exclaiming, "We are sinking! we are sinking!" At first the passengers
					were much frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.
					The danger could not be imminent. The <cite>Scotia</cite>, divided
					into seven compartments by strong partitions, could brave with
					impunity any leak. Captain Anderson went down immediately into the
					hold. He found that the sea was pouring into the fifth compartment;
					and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water was
					considerable. Fortunately this compartment did not hold the boilers,
					or the fires would have been immediately extinguished. Captain
					Anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at once, and one of the men
					went down to ascertain the extent of the injury. Some minutes
					afterwards they discovered the existence of a large hole of two yards
					in diameter, in the ship's bottom. Such, a leak could not be stopped;
					and the <cite>Scotia</cite>, her paddles half submerged, was obliged
					to continue her course. She was then three hundred miles from Cape
					Clear, and after three days' delay, which caused great uneasiness in
					Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.
				</p>
				<p>
					The engineers visited the <cite>Scotia</cite>, which was put in dry
					dock. They could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half
					below watermark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles
					triangle. The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly
					defined, that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It
					was clear, then, that the instrument producing the perforation was not
					of a common stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious
					strength, and piercing an iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn
					itself by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the
					torrent of public opinion. From this moment all unlucky casualties
					which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the
					monster.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these
					shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three
					thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyds, the number
					of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost, from the
					absence of an news, amounted to not less than two hundred!
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, it was the "monster" who, justly or unjustly, was accused of
					their disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the
					different continents became more and more dangerous. The public
					demanded peremptorily that the seas should at any price be relieved
					from this formidable cetacean.
